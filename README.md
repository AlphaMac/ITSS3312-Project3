perform various functions in the system. All inputs for the system and handled with scanners which all for use input, most if not all the processing for the systems is handled in methods, arrays serve as the storage for the data which are housed in classes and outputs are given at various points for feedback to the user

I like to do testing through trial and error, running with what I have and fixing when I
come across something that needs fixing, this usually brings up two to threes issues that Iâ€™ll need to address before I run it again to look for more.
